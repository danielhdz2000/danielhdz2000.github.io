### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because it's the very first project we created 
    and we learned so much during the first two weeks of this lab. We learned how 
    to use git commands like git clone, git add, git commit, and git push. In addition
    this lab taught is the importance of formatting and how a certain project should
    be formatted. We still continue to use these commands even in our last projects.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was my other favorite project because with this file we included math
    in averaging scores from different judges. However things became quickly complicated
    when we had to add certain restriction from judges like removing the lowest and highest
    scores to achieve fairness and prevent biased scores from the judges. In addition we began
    using other commands like make lint, make, and make test which were very helpful.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was my final favorite project, and was completed most recently. During this
    project we were asked to create an animated gif from individual images. It was amazing to run
    the commands needed to make the gif and see the final creation. Another point I want to add is
    the use of other files and being implemeted for a certain file. THese files are needed to run the
    main file smoothly and eficient.
